# Concursive SASS Boilerplate

** v.0.0.1 **

--------

### A prebuilt structure to speed up dev of css for a [Concursive platform](http://concursive.com)


I could no longer deal with the crazed spagetti that is a *ccp-color* stylesheet.

These .scss files are (relatively) well commented.

##### Caveat...

The css rules were grabbed from aba.preview.concursive.com in its current iteration and they therefor don't represent the full scope of elements. This will be updated and improved.


----

I use [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com) to manage SASS and Livereload.

This isn't neccessary, just convenient.
