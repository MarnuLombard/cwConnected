      <h2>Remembering Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela &emsp;
      <small>1918 - 2013</small></h2>
      <p>
        Former South African President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, who passed away on 5th December 2013, was an exemplary man who stood firmly for what was right. He stood up against corruption in any form, across every border. He called for the birth of a new morality.
      </p>
      <p>
        His resolute approach to rooting out corruption is captured in his 1996 State of the Nation Address in which he said, "Dealing with crime, violence and corruption requires a new morality for our new nation. Indeed, it requires a new patriotism among communities, the public and private sectors, and the security services - so that at the end of each day, each one of us can answer in the affirmative the question: have I done something today, to stamp out crime!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Corruption Watch pays tribute to his life, his work and his memory. We will work tirelessly to foster his anti-corruption stance in our country.

    <p class="lead">The school bell rings, reminding learners to focus on their studies and to take another step forward towards a positive future.

        More than half of respondents to our Mxit survey believed that corruption in schools is on the rise.

    </div>
    <div class="Xlight">
      <p>
        Selling of test and exam papers is a particular problem in Mpumalanga. Misuse of school money or property was prevalent in the Free State and the North West provinces.

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      Since our inception in 2012, 661 (12%) of the total number of reports received by Corruption Watch related to allegations of corruption in the schooling environment. After investigation, a substantial 554 (85%) of these reports were confirmed as being cases of corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reports indicated that principals, School Governing Body (SGB) members and to an extent, teachers, were manipulating and abusing the school system and processes to enrich themselves. Concerns reported ranged from abuse of public funds received for infrastructure maintenance and upgrading to sourcing of learning materials, funding of feeding schemes and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delving into the matter, Corruption Watch conducted a survey via Mxit, sampling 3 284 respondents. More than half of this sample, between the ages 13 and 34 years old, believed that corruption in schools is on the rise. Almost half of the respondents were learners at school or at a FET college, while 31% were family members of a school learner. Most learners (30%) were from public schools and just 8% were in private schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mxit survey, the first in a series of studies that Corruption Watch plans to conduct into corruption at schools, identified common forms of corruption such as the misuse of school finances and property, learners having to do favours in exchange for marks and nepotism in the appointment of staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="#" target="_blank">See the survey here.</a>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
       It also found that the selling of test and exam papers was a particular problem in Mpumalanga (23%), while the misuse of school money or property was especially prevalent in the Free State (30%) and the North West provinces (31%).
    </p>
    <p>
      It was further identified that the main person behind such corruption, according to 47% of all respondents, was the school principal, with 31% pointing a finger at teachers and 14% claiming that a member of the SGB was the culprit. The Eastern Cape was the province with the most corrupt principals (61%), the Free State (41%) had the worst teachers and the Northern Cape (33%), the most corrupt SGB members.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering our reporting data and findings from the Mxit survey, the common thread is that principals have been identified as the main wrongdoers in school corruption.

    <p>
      The ‘corruption concern in schools’ alert was one that we believed could not be underestimated and in response, Corruption Watch launched a Schools Campaign early in 2013, through which we aimed to raise awareness about the corruption reality in schools while encouraging the public to report their concerns. We also aimed to give power back to the public by informing them of their rights, enabling them to hold school leaders to account.

      Over 40% of the public reporting corruption in schools noted how disillusioned they were after lodging a complaint with various levels of the Department of Basic Education. Some corruption fighters who reported concerns to Corruption Watch indicated that even though a principal had been found guilty of misconduct or financial mismanagement, they were not removed from their post. Some were moved to a similar post in another school. A small number of our reporters indicated that they had taken their reports to channels such as the Public Protector, the SAP or the Premier of the province, but none of these efforts had produced results.

    <h3>Where is corruption at play? </h3>
    <p>
      There was a relatively even distribution of school-based corruption amongst provinces, with most of the reports emanating from the Eastern Cape (20%), Gauteng (19%) and Free State (18%). The number of reports focusing on Gauteng was lower this year but considering the higher proportion of the province’s population and the number of schools reported on, this geographic spread is relatively proportionate.

  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <h3>Who are the corruption fighters?</h3>

    <p>
      Of those that indicated their relationship to the school, over 36% of the reports came from teachers.   This was followed SGB members at 26% and parents at 24% submitting corruption concerns to Corruption Watch. Teachers have come out badly in terms of involvement in corruption but have also been the most vigilant in reporting it.

    Finding financial deceipt at Thubelihle
  </h2>

  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      In February 2013, Corruption Watch received a complaint from a group of teachers at Thubelihle Intermediate School in White City, Soweto. It was alleged that the principal, Nonzwakazi Usiba and former chairperson of the School Governing Body (SGB), Isaac Ngwenya, were tangled in corrupt activities. It was suspected that Usiba and Ngwenya were involved in the misuse of school funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      After investigation, Corruption Watch found mass evidence of fraud in the school’s finances. We commissioned an independent auditing firm to assess our findings. The auditors confirmed that corruption was evident and that Usiba and Ngwenya were directly implicated in the wrongdoings, which included:
    </p>


    <ul>
      <li>
        41 school cheques totalling R134 487.56, made out and cashed by Usiba. Some of the cheques stated “feeding for learners” but no corresponding invoices were found.
      </li>
      <li>
        10 school cheques totalling R41 059.30 were made out to Ngwenya and no invoices corresponded with the payment.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fake invoices were created for unknown individuals. For example, the school paid an amount of R48 064.74 to one individual against an invoice from Solly’s Packaging and Stationery Distributors, supposedly for calculators, pens and other stationery. It was unclear whether the stationery detailed in the fake invoice was ever delivered to the school and Solly’s Packaging told the forensic auditors that the invoice was not theirs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In August, Corruption Watch opened a police case against Usiba at Moroka Police Station in Soweto. The case currently sits with the Commercial Crimes Unit. Also based on findings, we approached the Gauteng Education Department (GED) and shared the forensic report with the district and provincial offices, who instituted their own investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal attempted to sidestep disciplinary processes by resigning with immediate effect. However, he was not let off the hook so easily. In this case, the GED forced him to remain in his post, though under suspension, until the investigation is complete.

      Intervention in the Eastern Cape
    </h2>

    <h3>
      Flagging the dire state of Macosa
    </h3>

    <p>
      Corruption Watch often receives reports from the public who believe that corruption is taking place at their schools. When we take a closer look there is sometimes no evidence of graft but just as often, other important issues are raised. One such case is Macosa Junior Secondary School in Mqanduli near Mthatha in the Eastern Cape, which had been deeply neglected by the Department of Basic Education.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were alerted to Macosa’s dire situation following a tip-off from a concerned citizen who viewed the lack of infrastructure at the school as a red flag for corruption. After investigation, it was established that the situation at Macosa was not one of outright corruption but rather of mismanagement, incompetence, lack of accountability and transparency as well as a failure to transfer funds.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      Macosa, for example, accommodates almost 500 pupils from poverty stricken communities. According to the principal, the school had not received furniture from the Department of Education since 1990 when she first started teaching there. What furniture remained was 23 years old and falling apart. Learners sat on concrete bricks and make-shift broken chairs, desks were falling apart, there were no proper toilets and the school buildings needed a fresh coat of paint.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a letter written to the Eastern Cape Department of Education in November 2013, the principal noted: <em>“Although we are an old school, for the past 23 years we never received any type of furniture …. hence we humbly write this letter to ask you if you can’t help us with your old furniture. We cannot even specify as to say tables, cupboards or chairs because we are just in dire need of any piece of furniture.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      These kinds of cases could involve the waste of public money or resources and as such, are a concern for Corruption Watch.

      Pupils pay a high price
    </h2>

    <h3>
      Wrong hands in the ‘cookie jar’
    </h3>

    <p>
      Children cannot grow and learn without eating balanced meals everyday, and for so many children in our country, their next meal comes from their School Feeding Programme. At one Primary School in Port Elizabeth, pupils paid a price that was way too high as a direct result of corrupt behaviour by those ‘in charge’.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just prior to the school holidays in September 2013 the principal of this school, together with the chairman of the School Governing Body awarded a R23 000 feeding scheme tender to an unnamed person. The twist here was that the ‘service provider’ was a mutual friend of theirs – and was unequipped to deliver child feeding in any way.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      The aftermath of the corruption uncovered at the Port Elizabeth school was unacceptable. Pupils were fed for one week before the ‘supplier’, who is now R23 000 richer, quit. The corruption fighter, who stood out from an accepting crowd by reporting the incident to Corruption Watch, told of how the principal was buying food from the supermarket because of the lack of supplies at the school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another Eastern Cape tip-off pointed to money being used for a principal’s personal needs. <em>“Signatories sign cheques for the principal to build her house. There are no chairs and desks and learners are forced to use bricks as chairs. Learners are not given food everyday because the principal buys a 12.5kg mieliemeel and one container of soup for 600 learners,”</em> reported this corruption fighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In both cases, vulnerable children paid the toll of inappropriate meals on their growing minds and bodies, and schools were cheated out of critical supplies. What else do these cases have in common? Just one report to Corruption Watch by a person who cared enough to speak up put the wheels of investigation and resolution into motion.

      Behind the scenes of breaking the silence
    </h2>
    <p>
      In 2012, Corruption Watch received reports that rural development NGO, Mvula Trust had obtained a government tender worth R30-million, irregularly. A four-month investigation began and in early 2013, we exposed Mvula Trust for fronting by subcontracting a significant part of the contract to a third party, Ubuntu Sima.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tender formed part of a job creation initiative for the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA), called the Community Work Programme (CWP).
    </p>
    <p>
      Following a number of allegations of illegality and complaints about the CWP, as well as pressure from Corruption Watch, COGTA instituted an independent, comprehensive inquiry to look into these allegations, including the award of a contract to Mvula Trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May 2013, Corruption Watch made submissions to the inquiry based on the findings of our investigation. We had found that the arrangement between the Mvula Trust and the third party was not disclosed in the initial bidding documents as required. To boot, a number of questionable links relating to conflicts of interest between the Trust and Ubuntu Sima were uncovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      We continue to pursue this issue and will advocate that there are consequences for those who attempt to corrupt the CWP.

    <h3>
      Accountant finds facts don’t add up
    </h3>

    <p>
      An email sent to the wrong address, followed by speedy reporting by a corruption fighter resulted in dodgy dealings being exposed at the Dr JS Moroka Municipality in Mpumalanga.
    </p>
    <p>
      In October 2012, the accounting officer for Seletech, that had supplied special glass vials in which drinking water was tested for over a year, received a strange email that included an official purchasing order invoice per set of 12 vials, valued at R24 000. Due to his own company supplying the same equipment for some time to the municipality for only R2 000 per set, he realised that something was not right.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      The email was meant to have been sent from the municipality to another company, Sinqobile &amp; Jose, but was sent to Seletech’s accounting officer by mistake. A short while before receiving the email, Seletech had received an order as usual from JS Moroka, but this time with an added instruction to deliver the vials not to the municipality – as it had done numerous times before – but to the offices of Sinqobile &amp; Jose. It was asked to give the package to a man called “Sipho”.
    </p>
    <p>
      On investigation into the unbalanced invoicing equation, Corruption Watch discovered that the procurement officer at the municipality who signed off on the   R24 000 payment to Sinqobile &amp; Jose was Rabelani Thukwana – who was married to Sipho Thukwana.happens to be the same person to whom Seletech was asked to deliver the set of vials last year and to whom Sinqobile &amp; Jose is registered.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of Corruption Watch’s investigation, three officials at the municipality were suspended.

      Unfit circumcision tender process diagnosed
    </h3>

    <p>
      In August 2013, following a corruption fighter’s complaint, Corruption Watch began investigating the Mpumalanga Health Department’s choice to award a multi-million rand tender to circumcise 260 000 boys and men in the province. Earlier in 2013, the department signed a one year-contract with Ebby Bongani Mkhabela, the owner of Mkhago Health Care Services to perform circumcisions at a cost of R700 per person, without advertising the contract.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      The bottom line of this case was that if all 260 000 circumcisions were completed,  Mkhago Healthcare Service would have been R182-million richer. Our investigation revealed that the public tender process was not followed in the awarding of the contract. By law all contracts over R500 000 must be awarded through a public competitive bidding process.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of Mkhago, Corruption Watch found that the company presented a business proposal and won the contract without having to go through the required tender process. The investigation also revealed that Mkhabela has been linked to a botched circumcision in 2008!
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on our findings, the Department of Health set out to conduct its own forensic investigation into the matter and in the meantime, the contract between the department and Mkhago is suspended.

      Constitutional Court resolves unconstitutional social grants tender
    </h3>

    <p>
      Corruption Watch continued to make a valuable contribution to the fight against corruption during 2012/13, as is shown in our participation in a Constitutional Court case involving Allpay Consolidated Investment Holdings (Allpay) and others v The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to our focus on encouraging vigilance in public procurement, Corruption Watch appeared in the Constitutional Court in a case in which the awarding of a R10-billion tender by SASSA to a private company, Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) for the distribution of social grants was being disputed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the region of 15 million people in South Africa depend on social grants, and for many this is their sole income. SASSA is responsible for the distribution of grants, subcontracting the distribution to a number of payment system firms. Where previously the subcontracts were entered in a provincial context, the R10 billion tender was given to CPS for the whole country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constitutional Court Judge Johan Froneman handed down a unanimous judgment, which found that the decision to award the tender to CPS was constitutionally invalid. As a friend of the court in this case, our 15-minute court appearance played a role in the enunciation of a clear legal standard in determining how irregularities in tender awards should be understood.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      Corruption Watch believes – and argued in court – that when a clear cut and relatively simple procedural requirement has not been met, we have to ask why. In its judgment the Constitutional Court referenced Corruption Watch’s contribution concerning irregularities in public procurement being red flags for corruption. The Court held that “deviations from fair process may themselves all too often be symptoms of corruption or malfeasance in the process. In other words, an unfair process may betoken a deliberately skewed process”.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the judgment Judge Froneman held that compliance with the requirements of a tender process is crucial and that insistence on compliance serves three purposes:

        <li>To ensure fairness to participants in the bid process</li>
        <li>To enhance the likelihood of efficiency and optimality in the outcome</li>
        <li>To serve as a guardian against a process skewed by corrupt influences</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Court found that SASSA had failed to investigate and confirm CPS’s Black Economic Empowerment credentials before awarding the business. It also found that the second bidders’ notice issued during the tender process was vague and uncertain, and gave rise to procedural unfairness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- Though despite the fact that the Court declared the award of the tender to CPS invalid, it remains in place for the time being. --> The Court has ordered the parties to return to court on 11 February 2014 to present evidence as to a “just and equitable” remedy.

      Anti-corruption lobbying on Public Administration Management Bill
    </h2>

    <p>
      In July 2013, Corruption Watch made written submissions to the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) on the new ‘Public Administration Management Bill’ (PAM Bill), which will replace the existing Public Service Act. We expressed general support to the DPSA for the initiative to provide for improved functioning, management and personnel-related matters within the public administration, through all tiers of government.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <h5>
      Specific submissions made were:
    </h5>

    <ol>
      <li>Prohibiting public officials from conducting business with the State. In our view, a ban on public officials doing business with the State should be extended to include a ban on immediate family members of public officials doing the same.</li>
      <li>Restriction of outside remunerative work.</li>
      <li>Prohibiting the re-employment of individuals if they are dismissed for misconduct.</li>
      <li>The introduction of a ‘cooling-off’ period before a public official can enter the private sector from the public sector.</li>

      Furthering legal action against the Construction Cartel

      Wrongdoers must pay the price
    </h2>

    <p>
      In July 2013, Corruption Watch made written submissions to the Competition Tribunal calling for those involved in the construction cartel to be prosecuted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The submission to the Competition Tribunal related to the hearings into the R1.46-billion settlement agreements facing top listed construction firms who rigged bids for, among other large projects, the FIFA 2010 World Cup™ infrastructure projects.
    </p>
    <h5>
      In the written submission, Corruption Watch:
    </h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Commended the Competition Commission for securing consent agreements with the 15 implicated companies and recommended that the Competition Tribunal confirm the settlements.</li>
      <li>Urged the Competition Commission to make provision for future ‘naming and shaming’ of individual perpetrators.</li>
      <li>Advised that the Competition Commission take swift action against those companies in the cartel who have not settled claims.</li>
      <li>Called on companies who agreed to the settlement to recover bonuses awarded to individuals named in the cartel.</li>
      <li>Called for a comprehensive and integrated approach to fighting corruption, which demands the involvement of multiple stakeholders, most importantly an engaged and active citizenry.</li>
      <li>Encouraged parties damaged by the cartel to file civil claims against the companies involved.</li>

    <h3>Clarifying the meaning of ‘conflicts of interest’</h3>

    <h5>
      Here’s how to determine whether you should report a concern that could be a conflict of interest.
    </h5>

    <p>
      A conflict of interest is any financial or other private interest or undertaking that could directly or indirectly compromise the performance of the public servant’s duties or the reputation of a public servant’s department in its relationship with its stakeholders.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example:
      <ul>
        <li>Holding public office as well as private business interests and using your public position to benefit your private interests.</li>
        <li>Influencing government tender processes so that your family members and friends are awarded State contracts.</li>
        <li>Abusing your position in a government department to ensure your friends and family are hired in the same department.</li>
        <li>Tendering for a municipal contract when you are an employee of the municipality.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      The need to take our country forward holding our heads high
    </h1>

    <p class="lead">
      A South African society that is against corrupt behaviour is not impossible to achieve, says <a href="#bio--david">David Lewis, Executive Director of Corruption Watch</a>. But it needs us to draw the line on where corruption begins and to rally together by speaking out against those who overstep this mark.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      2013 has been an eventful year for Corruption Watch. Reports of corruption have continued to stream in. We have launched our schools campaign, which has attracted <a href="#section--schools">large numbers of reports of school related corruption</a>.
    </p>


    <h5>
      Amplifying your voice
    </h5>

    <img src="img/megaphone--white.svg" alt="" class="one-quarter float--left" />

    <p>
      We have identified and exposed hotspots of corruption. We have concluded several successful investigations of individual acts of corruption and have successfully used your voice to pressurise the affected government departments to take action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="#section--construction_cartel">We made a powerful submission on the construction cartel</a> to the Competition Tribunal.  We also appeared in the Constitutional Court and made a major contribution to an important judgement that will make it far more difficult to corrupt tender awards.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is evidence that some powerful individuals in the public and private sectors are beginning to hear your voice.  As mentioned some government departments have responded positively to our investigations and have shown a willingness to co-operate with us in combatting corruption.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Stemming the flow
    </h5>

    <img src="img/school_corruption--icons-01.svg" alt="" class="one-third float--left" />

    <p>
      The Department of Public Service and Administration has published a Bill which, if successfully implemented, will go a long way towards stemming corruption in the public sector. It is beginning to dawn on elected representatives that if they continue to participate in or to ignore corruption they risk losing the last remnants of trust that you, the electorate, have in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But very troubling dark spots remain. For people who travel the roads and streets of South Africa, traffic policing can mean corruption.  For traders, corrupt municipal police may well be your everyday experience.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <h5>
      Turning our attention to elections
    </h5>

    <img src="img/school_corruption--icons-04_alt.svg" alt="" class="one-quarter float--left" />

    <p>
      We still have a mountain to climb and there is every indication that 2014 is going to be an even more eventful year.
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#subsection--mpumulanga_health">We are planning a campaign directed at corruption in the healthcare system</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="#section--your_voice_counts">We have introduced a new telephone hotline</a> to add to our existing platforms for reporting corruption.</li>
        <li>We are setting up an online and mobile phone platform that will enable us to build communities of corruption fighters.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      But mostly we expect 2014 to be eventful because of the impending national election. The opposition parties will no doubt want to persuade the electorate that the ruling party and the government that it has controlled since 1994 is riddled with corruption. The ruling party will want to persuade the public that it and the government is actively combatting corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our interest is not in who wins the electoral battle or who any of our corruption fighters choose to vote for. However  we have a very large interest in how elections are conducted and how our elected representatives – from whichever party they come – conduct themselves. We do not want the election outcome to be influenced by the power of big money. We want our elected representatives to demonstrate that they are accountable to the electorate.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Leaders beyond reproach
    </h5>

    <img src="img/investigation_alt.svg" alt="" class="one-sixth float--left" />

    <p>
      We want our elected representatives to serve the public rather than to see their position as an opportunity for enriching themselves.  What is becoming increasingly clear is that many of our most pressing corruption-related problems stem from powerful elected leaders at all levels of government, who in collaboration with wealthy individuals and business interests, consider themselves above the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up until now we have concentrated on the conduct of public officials and the private.  It is time to turn our attention to our elected representatives, those who are meant to represent an accountable democracy.

This period of his life is referenced in the title of his biography, From Robben Island to Bishopscourt. He studied abroad at King’s College in London, earning a bachelor of divinity, honours and master of theology in Christian ethics, and on his return to South Africa took up a post as rector of St Nicholas, Matroosfontein.

    <h3>Zwelinzima Vavi</h3>
    <h4>General secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions <em>(suspended)</em></h4>


    <p>
      Zwelinzima Vavi joined the Congress of South African Students a year after its official launch in 1979, but his activism for the struggles of the working class began in 1984 when he joined Vaal Reefs Gold Mine and became a shop steward – in 1987 he was dismissed following a 21-day strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vavi joined the National Union of Mineworkers as an organiser in the same year. In 1988, he became Cosatu’s regional secretary for the Western Transvaal (an area covering the North West, Vaal Triangle and northern parts of the Free State) and in 1992 took up the position of national organising secretary. He served as deputy general secretary from 1993 to 1999 and was then appointed as general secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2002 Vavi was made a member of the International Labour Organisation’s World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation. Four years later he was elected to the International Trade Union Confederation’s executive board and steering committee, and in 2007 he was appointed a member of the Local Organising Committee Board for the 2010 Fifa World Cup as well as its audit committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is presently on suspension as the general secretary of Cosatu, an organisation to which he has devoted three decades of service.
