    <blockquote>
      We have reason to be proud of our achievements over the past twenty years as a free and democratic country. Corruption in public places, if not exposed and vigorously opposed, will certainly limit economic development, deepen poverty and lead to unmanageable social instability.

    <blockquote>
      One of the greatest achievements of our time in South Africa has been the establishment of a Constitutional Democracy. Deepening it requires accountability, transparency, ethical leadership, an end to corruption, a passionate commitment to the promotion of the Common Good as well as a vigilant and robust civil society that is the conscience of the nation.

      <h2>Remembering Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela &emsp;
      <small>1918 - 2013</small></h2>
      <p>
        Former South African President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, who passed away on 5th December 2013, was an exemplary man who stood firmly for what was right. He stood up against corruption in any form, across every border. He called for the birth of a new morality.
      </p>
      <p>
        His resolute approach to rooting out corruption is captured in his 1996 State of the Nation Address in which he said, "Dealing with crime, violence and corruption requires a new morality for our new nation. Indeed, it requires a new patriotism among communities, the public and private sectors, and the security services - so that at the end of each day, each one of us can answer in the affirmative the question: have I done something today, to stamp out crime!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Corruption Watch pays tribute to his life, his work and his memory. We will work tirelessly to foster his anti-corruption stance in our country.

    <h4>
      Speak up against corruption.
    </h4>

    <p>
      People across the country are speaking out against corruption in their communities. Every one of these corruption fighters is making a difference and they do this by speaking up when they are confronted with dishonest dealings, public mismanagement of funds and general abuse of power. As a collective, if we are going to rip off the price tag on South Africa, we all need to become corruption fighters.

    <h4>
      Rip off the price tag.
    </h4>

    <p>
      We ignore corruption at our own peril. It not only threatens economic stability and investment, but also damages critical public confidence in leadership. How can we move forward without trust in our leaders, whether they are in government, at the helm of a corporate or in charge of a school programme?

    <p>
      Since the establishment of Corruption Watch in January 2012 we have received over 5 000 reports from the public. These reports are critical, enabling us to uncover and expose corruption and those who hold our nation to ransom. Our team of journalists, investigators, lawyers, researchers, data specialists and administrative staff and social justice activists are by nature, corruption fighters – and we are being joined by thousands more everyday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, we stand against abuse of public resources for private gain.
