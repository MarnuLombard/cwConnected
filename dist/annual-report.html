      In 2013, we learned more about our force of corruption fighters. We asked them what their views were on what constitutes a corrupt act, why they speak out against corruption and why they chose to report their experiences to Corruption Watch. For two years running, we have conducted an annual survey of a sample of those who reported to us so that we can get an indicative view of these corruption fighters.
    </p>

    <p class="lead smallish">
      In 2013, we surveyed a 10% sample, some 220 respondents. This sample is enough to give us a good indicative view of the corruption fighters who choose to interact with us. We found that more than 90% of the respondents were African, 81% were between the ages of 30 and 59, and 74% were men. The survey also told us that the average person who reports to CW is employed or self-employed, in the public sector rather than the private, and he lives in Gauteng. He has completed secondary schooling at least, and is likely to also have obtained a tertiary qualification. Because he likes to get his information through radio, television and internet, it's probable that he heard about Corruption Watch from those sources.

      South Africa is on a slippery slope of corruption. This is according to the Transparency International (TI) Corruption Perception Index, which measures perceived levels of public sector corruption in a number of countries. In 2012, SA was ranked 69th of 176 countries surveyed, while in 2013 the country slid down to 72nd out of the 177 countries. This may not be a massive fall, but it is an indicator of steady decline and South Africa's tarnished reputation for corrupt behaviour.

      South Africa was ranked 10th out of 48 African countries. Botswana, Cape Verde, Seychelles and Rwanda top these tables. Interestingly Lesotho, a small and highly impoverished country surrounded by South Africa, was ranked 55th of the 177 countries on the global index. In comparison with South Africa, Lesotho has few resources to combat corruption, yet it has dealt effectively with major domestic and international perpetrators of corruption including powerful multinational companies, as was evident in the Lesotho Water Highlands Project. Lesotho demonstrates that even with limited resources, it is possible to confront major corruption issues as long as there is the political will and determination to do so.

However, it must be emphasised that multi-national companies from those G20 members thought to be relatively corruption-free such as Canada, France, Germany and the US and UK are implicated in major corruption incidents occurring in developing countries.  Countries within the powerful G20 are not exempt from the need to combat corruption. Combatting corruption must be a major item on the G20 agenda.

    <p>
      Twenty-years ago South Africa stood at a precipice, unsure of the direction the winds of change would take. The months ahead of the 1994 elections brought a mixed bag of emotions. Many hoped for a better future and some doubted whether change would deliver it. The leadership of Nelson Mandela became the magic cauldron that held our fears, hopes, doubts, and aspirations together, and his passing in December has renewed the vision that South Africa can benefit all who live in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the greatest achievements of our time - attained through blood, sweat and tears - is the establishment of a Constitutional Democracy. For democracy to flourish, we need to honour, respect and support the instruments that are enshrined in the Constitution. Theologian, Reinhold Neibhur reminds us that our capacity for justice as human beings makes democracy possible; our inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is of the essence of a democracy for there to be checks and balances. The biggest threat to democracy is corruption and it is, for example with great concern that we witnessed tensions between the Government's Security Cluster and the Public Protector over the Nkandla debacle. All organs of State are required by the Constitution to assist and protect the Office of the Public Protector to ensure its independence, impartiality and effectiveness.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      Corruption is theft from the public. It requires a vigilant response and should be rejected by all. What we now need is a passionate commitment to the promotion of the Common Good. Over the past two years, many have turned to Corruption Watch to report incidents of corruption or share their stories about ways in which it has affected them. More than 5 000 cases were reported, registering a willingness by the public to play their part in deepening our democracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A united public voice can influence change. According to a campaign conducted by the African Monitor with youth across ten African countries, democratic governance is the biggest concern, with young people calling for an end to corruption and corrupt governments. They express frustration about the betrayal by elected leaders who have chosen to care more about their stomachs, pockets and bank accounts than they care about citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we face the 2014 elections and the future, our leaders need to know that we are ready to hold them to higher standards of accountability in the fulfilment of a just society, as it was envisioned by Madiba. We have set up an online and mobile platform and invite you to join the community of corruption fighters and make your voices heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each one of us can be a voice in our communities that promotes accountability and transparency. We stand to achieve better results when we do this as part of a community of like-minded people. To make inroads on corruption we need a robust and vigilant civil society, media and faith communities that can be the conscience of the nation.

      Remembering Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela &emsp;
      <small>1918 - 2013</small>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Former South African President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, who passed away on 5th December 2013, was an exemplary man who stood firmly for what was right. He stood up against corruption in any form, across every border. He called for the birth of a new morality.      </p>
    <p>
      His resolute approach to rooting out corruption is captured in his 1996 State of the Nation Address in which he said, "Dealing with crime, violence and corruption requires a new morality for our new nation. Indeed, it requires a new patriotism among communities, the public and private sectors, and the security services - so that at the end of each day, each one of us can answer in the affirmative the question: have I done something today, to stamp out crime!"      </p>
    <p>
      Corruption Watch pays tribute to his life, his work and his memory. We will work tirelessly to foster his anti-corruption stance in our country.      </p>

      The landscape of corruption in government shifted significantly this year. Reports on corruption in local and national government make this an area of concern for Corruption Watch. At roughly 33% each, local and provincial government shared similar volumes of reports. Notably, the dramatic increase in reports which focused on provincial government were driven by our focus on schools in 2013. Schools are managed under provincial Departments of Basic Education.

    <p>
      Since our inception in 2012, 661 (12%) of the total number of reports received by Corruption Watch related to allegations of corruption in schools. A substantial 554 (84%) of these reports were categorised as corruption as per our definition. </p>
    <p>
      Reports indicated that principals, School Governing Body (SGB) members and to an extent, teachers, were manipulating and abusing the school system and processes to enrich themselves. Concerns reported ranged from abuse of public funds received for infrastructure maintenance and upgrading to sourcing of learning materials, funding of feeding schemes and more.    </p>
    <p>
      Delving into the matter, Corruption Watch conducted a survey via Mxit, sampling 3 284 respondents. More than half of this sample, between 13 and 34 years of age, believed that corruption in schools is on the rise. Almost half of the respondents were learners at school or at a FET college, while 31% were family members of a school learner. Most learners (30%) were from public schools and just 8% were from private schools.    </p>
    <p>
      The Mxit survey, the first in a series of studies that Corruption Watch plans to conduct into corruption at schools, identified common forms of corruption such as the misuse of school finances and property, learners having to do favours in exchange for marks and nepotism in the appointment of staff. &emsp;<a href="http://www.corruptionwatch.org.za/content/survey-corruption-schools-rise" target="_blank">See the survey here.</a>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
     It also found that the selling of test and exam papers was a problem in Mpumalanga (23%), while the misuse of school money or property was prevalent in the Free State (30%) and the North West Province (31%).    </p>
    <p>
      It was further identified that the main person behind such corruption, according to 47% of all respondents, was the school principal, with 31% pointing a finger at teachers and 14% claiming that a member of the SGB was the culprit. Respondents in the Eastern Cape (61%) viewed principals as the most corrupt. In the Free State fingers were pointed at teachers (41%), whilst SGB members in the Northern Cape were identified as the main offenders.   </p>
    <p>
      Considering our reporting data and findings from the Mxit survey, the common thread is that principals have been identified as the main wrongdoers in school corruption.    </p>
    <p>
      The corruption in schools could not be underestimated and in response, Corruption Watch launched a Schools Campaign early in 2013, through which we aimed to raise awareness about the corruption reality in schools while encouraging the public to report their concerns. Our goal was to to give power back to the public by informing them of their rights and thereby, to enable them to hold school leaders to account.

Some were moved to a similar post in another school. A small number of our reporters indicated that they had taken their reports to channels such as the Public Protector, the SAP or the Premier of the province, but none of these efforts had produced results.    </p>

      There was a relatively even distribution of school-based corruption amongst provinces, with most of the reports emanating from the Eastern Cape (20%), Gauteng (19%) and Free State (18%). The number of reports focusing on Gauteng was lower this year, but considering the higher proportion of the province's population and the number of schools reported on, this geographic spread is relatively proportionate.    </p>

This was followed by SGB members at 26% and parents at 24% submitting corruption concerns to Corruption Watch. Teachers have emerged with a bad reputation in terms of involvement in corruption, but have simultaneously been the most vigilant in reporting it.    </p>

    Finding financial deceit at Thubelihle

    <p>
      In February 2013, Corruption Watch received a complaint from a group of teachers at Thubelihle Intermediate School in White City, Soweto. It was alleged that the principal, Nonzwakazi Usiba and others were using the school's resources for private gain.</p>

    <p>
      After investigation, Corruption Watch found massive evidence of fraud in the school's finances. We commissioned an independent  forensic firm to conduct an audit of the school's accounts. The forensic firm found gross irregularities, including on the part of the school principal:
    </p>
    <ul>

  <blockquote class="grid__item three-quarters">
    <p>
      What raised our suspicions was the fact that the same person [The former SGB chair] was elected repeatedly as chairperson of the SGB. There is protocol that must be followed when choosing members of the SGB and the principal. All parents of learners are eligible for election as a member of the SGB.
    <br />
      We decided at the last election that we did not want him [The former chair] back because he did not qualify to be a member of the SGB. We needed a new person with ideas and innovative thinking for the benefit of the school. Unfortunately though, he was elected once again even though he did not qualify.
    <br />
      The situation now is that the SGB feels that we acted unfairly against the principal. They are relatively new, so I understand where they are coming from. They were not there when things started going wrong.
    <br />
      There has been no honesty with regards to the running of the school and that looks bad in the eyes of the community. We don't have confidence in you [Usiba]. We don't need you.    </p>

My concern is that he crooked the SGB board to give him R12 000 for a court case that never took place. He claims to have represented the school at an out of court settlement meeting with a security company that used to guard our school. As a parent and a SGB member of the school, I request Corruption Watch to stop this person.&rdquo;    </p>

    Concerned anti-corruption parent</h5>
    <p>
    &ldquo;I am a parent of *** Primary in KwaZulu-Natal and I am writing this letter regarding our former principal Mr ***. Last year the governing body charged him with allegations of fraud, corruption and also serious mismanagement of school funds. He used the funds for a holiday in Cape Town. The Department of Education investigated the matter and found that there was enough merit to suspend him immediately. During his period of suspension the ******** offered him a post as their Deputy for Education and Training. The former principal seized the opportunity and resigned. This is unacceptable to me as a parent. A person who has been charged with fraud, corruption and serious mismanagement of school funds is now free.&rdquo;</p>

In 2012 the principal bought a BMW X6 using school money and the clerk is building a mansion in Mtubatuba, also with school money. The principal gave a tender to his girlfriend to build school offices with a higher price so that they can share the money left. The former chairperson of 2010 to 2012 was also abusing the school money for her personal needs.&rdquo;</p>

When it comes to term ending parties, money from the school coffers is used to buy food and alcohol beverages. Teachers are encouraged to choose and note down what they would prefer to drink.

      Intervention in the Eastern Cape    </h2>
    <h3>
      Flagging the dire state of Macosa    </h3>
    <p>
      Corruption Watch often receives reports from the public who believe that corruption is taking place at their schools. When we take a closer look there is sometimes no evidence of graft but just as often, other important issues are raised. One such case is Macosa Junior Secondary School in Mqanduli near Mthatha in the Eastern Cape, which had been deeply neglected by the Department of Basic Education.    </p>
    <p>
      We were alerted to Macosa's dire situation following a tip-off from a concerned citizen who viewed the lack of infrastructure at the school as a red flag for corruption. After investigation, it was established that the situation at Macosa was not one of outright corruption but rather one of neglect by the department.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      Macosa, for example, accommodates almost 500 pupils from poverty stricken communities. According to the principal, the school had not received furniture from the Department of Education since 1990 when she first started teaching there. What furniture remained was 23 years old and falling apart. Learners sat on concrete bricks and make-shift broken chairs, desks were falling apart, there were no proper toilets and the school buildings needed a fresh coat of paint.    </p>
    <p>
      In a letter written to the Eastern Cape Department of Education in November 2013, the principal noted:
    <em>
      &ldquo;Although we are an old school, for the past 23 years we never received any type of furniture…. hence we humbly write this letter to ask you if you can't help us with your old furniture. We cannot even specify as to say tables, cupboards or chairs because we are just in dire need of any piece of furniture.&rdquo;</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Department's spokesperson expressed sympathy for the school and said it is working hard to remedy the situation. Corruption Watch's involvement gave the school principal and learners a voice.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <h2 class="lowlight">
      Pupils pay a high price    </h2>
    <h3>
      Wrong hands in the &rdquo;cookie jar&ldquo;    </h3>
    <p>
      Children cannot grow and learn without eating balanced meals everyday, and for so many children in our country, their next meal comes from their School Feeding Programme. At one Primary School in Port Elizabeth, pupils paid a price that was way too high as a direct result of corrupt behaviour by those ‘in charge'.    </p>
    <p>
      Just prior to the school holidays in September 2013 the principal of this school, together with the chairman of the School Governing Body awarded a R23 000 feeding scheme tender to an unidentified person. The twist here was that the ‘service provider' was a mutual friend of theirs &mdash; and was unequipped to deliver child feeding in any way.    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      The aftermath of the corruption uncovered at the Port Elizabeth school was unacceptable. Pupils were fed for one week before the ‘supplier', who is now R23 000 richer, quit.  The corruption fighter who reported to Corruption Watch noted that the principal had to buy food from the supermarket because of the lack of supplies at the school.</p>
    <p>
      Another Eastern Cape tip-off pointed to money being used for a principal's personal needs. <em>&ldquo;Signatories sign cheques for the principal to build her house. There are no chairs and desks and learners are forced to use bricks as chairs. Learners are not given food everyday because the principal buys a 12.5kg mieliemeel and one container of soup for 600 learners,&rdquo;</em> reported this corruption fighter.    </p>
    <p>
      In both cases, vulnerable children paid the toll of inappropriate meals on their growing minds and bodies, and schools were cheated out of critical supplies. What else do these cases have in common? Just one report to Corruption Watch by a person who cared enough to speak up put the wheels of investigation and resolution into motion.    </p>

      Breaking the silence
    </h2>
    <p>
      In 2012, Corruption Watch received reports that rural development NGO, Mvula Trust had irregularly obtained a government tender worth R30-million. A four-month investigation began. In early 2013, we exposed Mvula Trust for fronting by subcontracting a significant part of the contract to a third party, Ubuntu Sima, a company owned by a trustee of Mvula Trust.</p>
    <p>
      The tender formed part of a job creation initiative for the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA), called the Community Work Programme (CWP).    </p>
    <p>
      Following a number of allegations of illegality and complaints about the CWP, as well as pressure from Corruption Watch, COGTA instituted an independent, comprehensive inquiry to look into these allegations, including the award of a contract to Mvula Trust.    </p>
    <p>
      In May 2013, Corruption Watch made submissions to the inquiry based on the findings of our investigation. We found that the arrangement between the Mvula Trust and the third party was not disclosed in the initial bidding documents, as required. A number of questionable links relating to conflict of interest between the Trust and Ubuntu Sima were uncovered.</p>
    <p>
      We continue to pursue this issue and will advocate that there are consequences for those who attempt to corrupt the CWP.    </p>

      Rapid reporting uncovers municipal scandal    </h2>

      Accountant finds facts don't add up    </h3>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      An email sent to the wrong address, followed by speedy reporting by a corruption fighter resulted in dodgy dealings being exposed at the Dr JS Moroka Municipality in Mpumalanga.
    </p>
    <p>
      In October 2012, the accounting officer for Seletech, that had supplied special glass vials in which drinking water was tested for over a year, received a strange email that included an official purchasing order invoice per set of 12 vials, valued at R24 000 each. Due to his company supplying the same equipment for some time to the municipality for only R2 000 per set, he realised that something was not right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The email was meant to have been sent from the municipality to another company, Sinqobile &amp; Jose, but had been sent to Seletech's accounting officer.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
     A short while before receiving the email, Seletech received an order as usual from JS Moroka, but this time with an added instruction not to deliver the vials to the municipality, as it had done numerous times before. It was advised to deliver the vials to the offices of Sinqobile &amp; Jose, to a man named &ldquo;Sipho&rdquo;.    </p>
    <p>
      On investigation into the unbalanced invoicing equation, Corruption Watch discovered that the procurement officer at the municipality who signed off on the R24 000 payment to Sinqobile &amp; Jose happened to be married to &ldquo;Sipho&rdquo;, the same person to whom Seletech was asked to deliver the vials and to whom Sinqobile &amp; Jose was registered. This was undoubtedly an undeclared conflict of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result of Corruption Watch's investigation, three officials at the municipality were suspended.

      Unfit circumcision tender process diagnosed    </h3>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      In August 2013, following a corruption fighter's complaint, Corruption Watch began investigating the Mpumalanga Health Department's decision to engage a private company Mkhago Health Care Services to circumcise 260 000 boys and men in the province. The bottom line of this case was that if all 260 000 circumcisions had been completed, Mkhago Healthcare Service would have been R182-million richer.</p>
    <p>
      Our investigation revealed that  no public tender process was followed in the awarding of the contract to Mkhago. By law all contracts over R500 000 must be awarded through a public competitive bidding process, unless exceptional circumstances exist such as an emergency</p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      In the case of Mkhago, Corruption Watch found that the company presented a business proposal and won the contract without having to go through the required competitive tender process. The investigation also revealed that the owner of the private company Dr. Ebby Mkhabela  was linked to a botched circumcision in 2008 </p>
    <p>
      Corruption Watch alerted the provincial and national Departments of Health to the situation. Based on our findings, the Department of Health in Mpumalanga set out to conduct its own forensic investigation into the matter and in the meantime, the contract between the department and Mkhago was suspended.</p>

      Constitutional Court resolves unconstitutional social grants tender
    </h3>
  </div>

  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      Corruption Watch continued to make a valuable contribution to the fight against corruption during 2012/13, as is shown in our participation in a Constitutional Court case involving Allpay Consolidated Investment Holdings (Allpay) and others v The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) and others.    </p>
    <p>
      Due to our focus on encouraging vigilance in public procurement, Corruption Watch appeared in the Constitutional Court in a case which involved the awarding of a R10-billion tender by SASSA to a private company, Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), for the distribution of social grants.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the region of 15 million people in South Africa depend on social grants, and for many this is their sole income. SASSA is responsible for the distribution of grants, subcontracting the distribution to a number of payment system firms. Where previously the subcontracts were entered in a provincial context, the R10 billion tender for the whole country was given to CPS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constitutional Court Judge Johan Froneman handed down a unanimous judgment in November 2013, which found that the decision to award the tender to CPS was constitutionally invalid. As a friend of the court in this case, our 15-minute court appearance played a role in the enunciation of a clear legal standard in determining how irregularities in tender awards should be understood.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item one-half">
    <p>
      Corruption Watch believes &mdash; and argued in court &mdash; that when a clear cut and relatively simple procedural requirement has not been met, we have to ask why. In its judgment the Constitutional Court referenced Corruption Watch's contribution concerning irregularities in public procurement being red flags for corruption. The Court held that &ldquo;deviations from fair process may themselves all too often be symptoms of corruption or malfeasance in the process. In other words, an unfair process may betoken a deliberately skewed process&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the judgment, Judge Froneman held that compliance with the requirements of a tender process was crucial and that insistence on compliance served three purposes:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
      To ensure fairness to participants in the bid process</li>
      <li>
      To enhance the likelihood of efficiency and optimality in the outcome</li>
      <li>
      To serve as a guardian against a process skewed by corrupt influences</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The Court found that SASSA had failed to give sufficient regard to the importance of Black Economic Empowerment in procurement. SASSA was obliged to confirm the empowerment credentials of bidders before awarding tenders. It also found that the Second Bidders' notice issued during the tender process was vague and uncertain, which gave rise to procedural unfairness.</p>
    <p>
      The Court ordered the parties to return to court on 11 February 2014 to present evidence as to a &ldquo;just and equitable&rdquo; remedy.    </p>

      Clarifying the meaning of ‘conflict of interest'</h3>
    <h5>
      Here's how to determine whether you should report a concern that could be a conflict of interest.    </h5>
    <p>
      A conflict of interest is any financial or other private interest or undertaking that could directly or indirectly compromise the performance of the public servant's duties or the reputation of a public servant's department in its relationship with its stakeholders.    </p>

    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      Holding public office as well as private business interests and using your public position to benefit your private interests.</li>
      <li>
      Influencing government tender processes so that your family members and friends are awarded State contracts.</li>
      <li>
      Abusing your position in a government department to ensure  that your friends and family are hired in the same department.</li>
      <li>
      Tendering for a municipal contract when you are an employee of the municipality.</li>

      The Department of Public Service and Administration has published a Bill which, if successfully implemented, will go a long way towards stemming corruption in the public sector.&emsp;It is beginning to dawn on elected representatives that if they continue to participate in or ignore corruption, they risk losing the last remnants of trust that you, the electorate, have in them.</p>
    <p>
      But very troubling dark spots remain. For people who travel the roads and streets of South Africa, traffic policing can mean corruption.&emsp;For traders, corrupt municipal police may well be your everyday experience. Those who have followed the Nkandla saga, or the doings of Minister Tina Joemat-Petterson or the former minister of communications, Dina Pule, will conclude that with the right political connection you could get away with anything. </p>

      Turning our attention to elections    </h5>
    <img src="/themes/corruption-watch/color-schemes/grey/img/school_corruption--icons-04_alt.png" alt="" class="one-quarter float--left" />
    <p>
      We still have a mountain to climb and there is every indication that 2014 is going to be an even more eventful year.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#subsection--mpumulanga_health">We are planning a campaign directed at corruption in the healthcare system</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="#section--your_voice_counts">We have introduced a new telephone hotline</a> to add to our existing platforms for reporting corruption.</li>
      <li>We are setting up an online and mobile phone platform that will enable us to build communities of corruption fighters.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But mostly, we expect 2014 to be eventful because of the impending national election. The opposition parties will no doubt want to persuade the electorate that the ruling party and government that it has controlled since 1994 is riddled with corruption. The ruling party will want to persuade the public that it and the government is actively combatting corruption.    </p>
    <p>
      Our interest is not in who wins the electoral battle or who any of our corruption fighters choose to vote for.&emsp;However,  we have a very large interest in how elections will be conducted and how our elected representatives &mdash; from whichever party they come &mdash; conduct themselves. We do not want the election outcome to be influenced by the power of big money. We want our elected representatives to demonstrate that they are accountable to the electorate.    </p>
    <h5>
      Leaders beyond reproach    </h5>
    <img src="/themes/corruption-watch/color-schemes/grey/img/investigation_alt.png" alt="" class="one-sixth float--left" />
    <p>
      We want our elected representatives to serve the public rather than to see their position as an opportunity for enriching themselves.  What is becoming increasingly clear is that many of our most pressing corruption-related problems stem from powerful elected leaders at all levels of government, who in collaboration with wealthy individuals and business interests, consider themselves above the law.    </p>
    <p>
      Up until now we have concentrated on the conduct of public officials and the private.  It is time to turn our attention to our elected representatives, those who are meant to represent an accountable democracy.    </p>
